./VELA** is gen 2 while ./VELA_v2_** is gen3
Both gen2 and gen3 have the same format exactly, which I will detail now.

First, a few general notes: ---------------------- 

Below, I will use "cold" mass to refer to the mass of cold gas
(T<1.5x10^4 K) and young stars (age < 100 Myr).  Many of the
properties below refer to the disc cylinder. Very briefly, the disc
orientation, radius and height (half-thickness) are computed
iteratively and self consistently. The radius contains 85% of the mass
of cold gas and young stars within a cylinder of radius 0.15*Rvir,
thickness 2kpc (+/-1kpc from the midplane) and aligned with the disc
angular momentum. The thickness contains 85% of the mass of cold gas
and young stars within a cylinder of radius Rd, thickness 2Rd (+/-Rd
from the midplane) and aligned with the disc angular momentum.  The
orientation is set by the angular momentum of all the cold mass in the
disc cylinder.  If you want more details, please ask me. You can also
look at Appendix B of my 2014 paper.  When I refer to the "cold" disc
mass (or the disc gas mass) I mean all the cold material (or all the
gas) located within the disc cylinder (see below).  However, when I
refer to the disc "stellar" mass, I apply an additional kinematic
criterion for the "old" stars, assigning them to the disc only if
their angular momentum parallel to the disc angular momentum is at
least 70% of the maximal angular momentum they can have given their
galactocentric distance and velocity.  In other words, "disc stars"
are those stars with jz/(m*r*v) > 0.7 The same kinematic criterion was
applied to the dark matter when computing the "disc dark matter mass",
which appears in one of the catalogs.  Whenever mass is computed in a
sphere, no kinematic criterion is applied.  SFR is computed in a
somewhat complicated way, averaging over many different age windows to
smooth out the discreteness in the formation times of stellar
particles.  Basically, you can think of the quoted SFR values as
representative of star formation on 60Myr timescales If you want more
details, please ask me.  In ./VELA**/galaxy_catalogue/ there are 7
files.  Several of these may be redundant and there is information
appearing in several files. I will describe them one by one, in order
of "importance" or "relevance".  If you want me to combine some of
these different files, get rid of some them or even add some missing
properties, this can be easily done. Just ask me!

Nir_simplified_disc_cat.txt 
---------------------- 
These are the files that contain the center of the main galaxy, which
you will need for analysing the simulations with YT.  The first line
has the number if snapshots analyzed.  Then there is one line per
snapshot, where the columns are as follows:

column 1: expansion factor 
column 2: ID number of the stellar particle closest to the galaxy
center (NOT at the actual center)
columns 3-5: (x, y, z) of the stellar particle with respect to the
galaxy center, in kpc. To center on the galaxy, move your center so
that the particle with the above ID is located at this position. The
orientation of the box (the x, y and z dir ections themselves) is the
same as in the raw data.
columns 6-8: (vx, vy, vz) of the stellar particle with respect to the
galaxy center, in km/s. To move to the galaxies rest frame, shift all
your velocities so that the particle with the above ID has this
velocity vector.
columns 9-11: (Lx, Ly, Lz) Unit vector telling you the direction of
the disc angular momentum. This determines what I call "face on".
column 12: Disc radius, in kpc.  column 13: Disc height (half the
thickness), in kpc.

Nir_disc_cat.txt
-------------
Contains physical properties of the disc cylinder. Ask me for further
details on how exactly this cylinder is determined.  The first line
has the number if snapshots analyzed.
Then there is one line per snapshot, where the columns are as follows:
column 1: expansion factor
columns 2-4: (xcm, ycm, zcm) Center of mass of the cold component
within the disc cylinder, in kpc. This will tell you how much the gas
(and young stars) are off-set from the total stars, which determine
the galaxy center.
columns 5-7: (vxcm, vycm, vzcm) Center of mass velocity of the cold
component within the disc cylinder, in km/s. This will tell you how
much the gas (and young stars) are off-set from the total stars, which
determine the galaxy rest frame.
columns 8-10: (Lx, Ly, Lz) Unit vector telling you the direction of
the disc angular momentum. This determines what I call "face on".
column 11: Magnitude of the disc specific angular momentum, whose unit
vector is given above, in kpc*km/s. Recall this only refers to the
cold component.
column 12: Disc radius, in kpc. 
column 13: Disc height (half the thickness), in kpc. 
column 14: Disc gas mass, in M_{sun}
column 15: Disc cold mass, in M_{sun}
column 16: Disc stellar mass, in M_{sun} (recall the kinematic criterion).
column 17: Mass of ex situ stars (formed outside the disc and accreted), in M_{sun} (recall the kinematic criterion).
column 18: Disc dark matter mass, in M_{sun} (recall the kinematic criterion).
column 19: Disc SFR, in M_{sun} yr^{-1}
column 20: Mass weighted mean stellar age of the disc, in Myr

column 22: Stellar phase metallicity in the disc, in log(O/H)+12
